# 🏥 Hospital Management System

This project, **Hospital Management System**, is a full-featured web application built using **PHP and MySQL**. It is designed to simplify the workflow and day-to-day operations in a hospital by providing separate roles for **Admin**, **Doctors**, and **Receptionists**.

Developed as part of my Bachelor of Computer Technology degree under the guidance of Dr. R. Jayaprakash at **Nallamuthu Gounder Mahalingam College**, this system helps in managing:

- Patient registrations
- Doctor appointments
- Billing and payment
- Role-based dashboards and access
- Report generation
